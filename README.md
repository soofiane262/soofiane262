### Hi there 👋

𝕀𝕋 𝘈𝘳𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘵𝘦𝘤𝘵 𝘌𝘹𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘵 to be…

🔭 I’m currently working on a project whith C inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever, enabling me to explore ray-casting. My goal is to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which I’ll have to find my way 🤓.

I am also making my debuts in C++ with the CPP Pool Modules of the 42 Cursus.
